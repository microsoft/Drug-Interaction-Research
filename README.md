# Drug Interaction Research by Artificial Intelligence

## Overview

The project collects our AI-aided drug interaction research including drug-target interaction prediction, drug-drug interaction prediction, drug combinations, drug pair interaction prediction and so on. 

## News

### Jan 2023
- *DSN-DDI: an accurate and generalized framework for drug–drug interaction prediction by dual-view representation learning* is published by *Briefings in Bioinformatics*. (https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bib/bbac597/6966537)
- The source code and the pretrained models are available at [DSN-DDI-for-DDI-Prediction branch](https://github.com/microsoft/Drug-Interaction-Research/tree/DSN-DDI-for-DDI-Prediction) and give it a star if you find it useful!
